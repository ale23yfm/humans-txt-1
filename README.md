# The Importance of Human Intelligence

In the era of AI, there is often a significant focus on the advancement of artificial intelligence and technology. However, it's important not to forget the significance of human intelligence and our distinct capabilities.

[humanstxt.org](http://humanstxt.org) is an initiative that may have been overshadowed by the rapid advancements in AI, but it carries an essential message: **WE ARE PEOPLE, NOT MACHINES**.

## Remembering Our Humanity

This initiative is about promoting the original message of [humanstxt.org](http://humanstxt.org) - the idea that even in a world increasingly driven by technology, we should always remember and celebrate our humanity.

Let's not lose sight of the fact that behind all the machines and AI, it is the creativity, empathy, and ingenuity of humans that truly drive progress.
